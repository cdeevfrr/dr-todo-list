# What's this?

I have a TODO list 

# Deploying

I should have this set up to deploy with `gcloud app deploy -v a` (the app.yaml combined with the google login secrets stored on my machine should make it work). `gcloud app deploy --verbosity=debug` is helpful if you're having problems.

You can then use `gcloud app browse` for it to go straight to the right webpage.
